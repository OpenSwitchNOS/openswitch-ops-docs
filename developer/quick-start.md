# Quick Start Guide

The following guide describes an easy way to set up your development environment for the OpenSwitch project using  [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com).  The Vagrant image includes an Ubuntu VM with Docker already installed. Docker is used to run the OpenSwitch project image on a Linux container.

This approach has been tested on Windows 7 with Vagrant 1.7.4 and VirtualBox 5.0.

## Development environment features

* A VM running Ubuntu with the OpenSwitch development environment in `~/ops-build/`.
* An OpenSwitch x86_64 image built and ready to be used.
* An instance of OpenSwitch (the x86_64 image) running inside a Docker container.

**Note:** The username/password for the VM is the default vagrant/vagrant.

## Installing the OpenSwitch project development environment
1. Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
2. Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
3. Install the required Vagrant plugins. Use the following command:
``` bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
```
4. If you are behind a proxy, install the `vagrant-proxyconf` plugin:
```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-proxyconf
```

**Note:** The latest versions of Vagrant and VirtualBox are recommended, as Docker support is not present in older versions of Vagrant.

## Configuring the system to work with OpenSwitch

1. Download and unzip the [Vagrant files](https://github.com/shadansari/openswitch-vagrant/archive/master.zip) into a workspace directory.

2. If you are behind a proxy, set the proxy `host:port` info in the `host/Vagrantfile`. The `host/Vagrantfile` is located in the workspace directory where you unzipped the Vagrant files.
```bash
config.proxy.http = "http://proxy.example.com:8080"
config.proxy.https = "https://proxy.example.com:8080"
```
3. Browse to your workspace directory and run `vagrant up`.
```bash
$ cd openswitch-vagrant-master
$ vagrant up
```
**Note:** The first `vagrant up` process can take a while since the entire OpenSwitch repository is fetched and built.

## Connecting to the OpenSwitch instance
After following the steps above *"Configuring the system to work with OpenSwitch"*, an OpenSwitch image has been built and Docker has been configured to run that OpenSwitch image. Use the following steps to connect to OpenSwitch. The following steps are performed in the newly created Ubuntu VM.

1. Run a shell on the Docker instance with `docker exec -ti ops bash`
2. Run `vtysh` to start the OpenSwitch  CLI.

Example:

```bash
vagrant@ops-host:~/ops-build$ docker exec -ti ops bash
bash-4.3# vtysh
2015-09-01T23:31:47Z|00001|reconnect|INFO|unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock: connecting...
2015-09-01T23:31:47Z|00002|reconnect|INFO|unix:/var/run/openvswitch/db.sock: connected
```

## Build system and development environment
After following the above instructions, the newly created Ubuntu VM has been fully installed with the OpenSwith Build System and Development Environment. The OpenSwitch Build System creates and maintains a Git repository that is cloned to `~/ops-build`. The Git repository contains a subset of the project's source files. For details on how to manage it, see the [Development Environment](./development-environment.html) guide.
