<!--  See the https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for additional information about markdown text.
Here are a few suggestions in regards to style and grammar:
* Use active voice. With active voice, the subject is the doer of the action. Tell the reader what
to do by using the imperative mood, for example, Press Enter to view the next screen. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_voice for more information about the active voice.
* Use present tense. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_tense for more information about using the present tense.
* The subject is the test case. Explain the actions as if the "test case" is doing them. For example, "Test case configures the IPv4 address on one of the switch interfaces". Avoid the use of first (I) or second person. Explain the instructions in context of the test case doing them.
* See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aManual_of_Style for an online style guide.
