<!--

Use the following guidelines for writing OPS documentation

Here are a few suggestions in regards to style and grammar:
* Use active voice. With active voice, the subject is the doer of the action. Tell the reader what
to do by using the imperative mood, for example, Press Enter to view the next screen. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_voice for more information about the active voice.
* Use present tense. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_tense for more information about using the present tense.
* Avoid the use of I or third person. Address your instructions to the user. In text, refer to the reader as you (second person) rather than as the user (third person). The exception to not using the third-person is when the documentation is for an administrator. In that case, *the user* is someone the reader interacts with, for example, teach your users how to back up their laptop.
* See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aManual_of_Style for an online style guide.
* Remember to use articles (a, an, and the), see https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/540/01/ for more information on when and how to use them.
* The title should always been in title case; however, all following headings should be in sentence case, where only the initial word is capitalized. The other words in the heading should be in lowercase letters unless they are an acronym or a proper noun.

About markdown
* See the https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for additional information about markdown text.
* StackEdit automatically creates an anchor tag based off of each heading.  Spaces and other nonconforming characters are substituted by other characters in the anchor when the file is converted to HTML.

Important
* After you have added your text, remove the comments within the template. Some tools display comments and all HTML tags as text in its output.

Formatting guidelines

Diagrams:
When adding a diagram, make sure that ```ditaa is before the diagram and ``` is after the diagram, as shown in the following graphic.

```ditaa
+----+   +----+
|    +---+    |
+----+   +----+
```

Adding example commands:
When you add an example within a step, it must be indented and proceeded by only one empty line and followed by only one empty line; otherwise the numbering in the procedure will be disrupted. A correct example is shown in the following example:

1. Step 1 Description

 ```
 example here
 ```

2. Step 2 Description

Spacing:
A space must be proceeded after:
- A hash tag in the heading, as in ## My heading
- A bullet, as in â€“ first bullet
- A number, as in 1. First step

# Feature name
<!-- Provide the title of the feature -->

## Contents
<!--
Suggestions for generating the table of contents:
1. Use the markdown-toc package for generating a table of contents in Atom
2. Remove comments generated by Atom.
3. Remove the top-level heading and the Contents heading from the TOC.
4. Make sure the top-level TOC tags are flush against the left side, so the links are active. You can confirm if the links are active in http://StackEdit.io.
5. Remove the level of headings that are redundant, as the links will only go to the first instance.
6. If the heading contains special characters, remove the special characters in the TOC links.
7. Use http://StackEdit.io to determine if the TOC links work properly.
