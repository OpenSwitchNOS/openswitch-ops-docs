## Pick a stable OpenSwitch Image

Before you begin, you'll want to locate a stable build. This can be from a release branch or master branch. Refer to [versioning_in_ops](http://www.openswitch.net/documents/dev/version-control)
   If you want to pick a stable image from master branch where new features are actively developed, follow steps below:
     1. We'll use the [test_results_analyzer](https://jenkins.openswitch.net/job/ops-periodic-genericx86-64/test_results_analyzer/) to get information on a stable build.
     2. Click on "Get Build Report" and "Select chart type" -> "bar". This shows at a glance, which builds are most stable and have run maximum number of passed testcases.
     3. Pick the build number which you'll like to use, for eg: 823 is the most stable build at the time of writing.
     4. Now use this build number and go to https://jenkins.openswitch.net/job/ops-periodic-genericx86-64/<build_number>/testResults. This testResults page displays all the tests which were run on this periodic build. For example: [build_823_test_results](https://jenkins.openswitch.net/job/ops-periodic-genericx86-64/823/testResults)
     5. Use testResults information you get a clear idea of which features are tested with this periodic build. If this build does not satisfy your requirements, please choose another build and repeat all of the above steps.
     6. Note the timestamp of the periodic build you've chosen from https://jenkins.openswitch.net/job/ops-periodic-genericx86-64/<build_number>/. You'll need this info to continue Install on AS5712 or using it as a virtual appliance.

## Installing OpenSwitch on an AS5712

This guide will use AS5712 as an example. Please see [hw compatible](http://openswitch.net/documents/user/hardware-compatibility) guide for other platforms.

a. After choosing a stable build, using the timestamp you've noted from "Pick a stable OpenSwitch" Image step. download the OPS ONIE installer image from https://archive.openswitch.net/artifacts/periodic/master/0.3.0+<YYYYMMDDHH>/as5712/. For example: [build_823_onie_installer](https://archive.openswitch.net/artifacts/periodic/master//0.3.0+2016031100/openswitch-onie-installer-x86_64-as5712_54x-0.3.0+2016031100)

b. If you have networking setup on your AS5712 and an accessible tftp server
   1. Copy the downloaded OPS image into the tftp directory with the name ops_as5712
   2. Telnet to the switch, reboot, get the switch into ONIE Rescue OS mode and enter these commands
        ```
        1. tftp –g –r ops_as5712 –l ops_5712 <tftp_server>
        2. chmod +x ops_as5712
        3. export OPS_CLEAN_INSTALL=true
        4. ./ops_5712
        ```
   3. Reboot and OPS will be booted up

c. If you don’t have networking setup, follow the below steps
     (for the below steps, Windows laptop running Windows 7 Enterprise is used)

1. USB to Serial adapter should be used.  For this case, Belkin Serial Adapter, model F5U257 is used.  The corresponding driver for Windows 7 Enterprise can be found at http://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?articleNum=4644
2. Connect the USB to serial adapter to the Windows laptop and install the driver.
3. Make sure the new device shows up in Device Manager under Ports (COM & LPT) as Belkin USB-to-Serial-Adapter(COMx) x after COM will vary based on the USB port to which it is connected.
4. Copy the OPS onie installer image to a USB device.  Use the installer you've identified in Step a above.
5. Connect the windows laptop to AS5712 switch using the USB to Serial adapter
6. Using putty, choose Serial line as COM<> and Speed as 115200
7. Once connected to the switch, reboot the switch

8. Wait for the menu
    ```bash

    ```
    In the ONIE prompt, run fdisk -l as below

    ```bash

     ONIE:/ #

     ONIE:/ # fdisk -l

    Partition 1 has different physical/logical endings:
         phys=(30, 254, 63) logical=(31, 124, 29)
    ```

    Pick the partition that has the flash drive inserted (/dev/sdb1 in this case) and mount it:
    ```bash
    ONIE:/ # mkdir /mnt/usb_drive_mount_point
    ONIE:/ # mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb_drive_mount_point/
    ```

    Copy the onie installer file to a folder
    ```bash
    ONIE:/ # ls /mnt/usb_drive_mount_point/
    openswitch-onie-installer-x86_64-as5712_54x-0.3.0+2016031100

    mkdir /onie-installer/
    cp  /mnt/usb_drive_mount_point/openswitch-onie-installer-x86_64-as5712_54x-0.3.0+2016031100 /onie-installer/
    ```

    Run the installer:
    ```bash
    ONIE:/onie-installer # ./openswitch-onie-installer-x86_64-as5712_54x-0.3.0\+2016031100

    ONIE:/onie-installer # ./openswitch-onie-installer-x86_64-as5712_54x-0.3.0\+2016031100

    Initializing Intel(R) Boot Agent GE v1.5.43
    PXE 2.1 Build 092 (WfM 2.0)
    Press Ctrl+S to enter the Setup Menu..

    --- Installing OpenSwitch GRUB ---
    Installation finished. No error reported.

    OpenSwitch installation completed

    Rebooting...
    ```

    Once rebooted, login as root and check the version.  It should match with the one that was installed:
    ```bash
    root@switch:~# vtysh
    switch# show version
    OpenSwitch 0.3.0 (Build: 0.3.0+20160311008-0.3.0-20160311001048-dev)
    switch#
    ```

    Now ip address details can be configured for telnet access to the switch.

d. Now that you have the switch booting to OpenSwitch:

   1. Telnet to the switch and login as root. Currently no password is set for root.
   2. You will notice a bash prompt. Now enter "vtysh"
   2. After entering vtysh, type "show ?". You should be able to see a bunch of familiar show commands for different features.
   3. Try the following sample config for simple networking:
      1. conf t
      2. ip route &lt;destination&gt; &lt;nexthop | interface&gt; [&lt;distance&gt;]
      3. detailed reference can be found at http://openswitch.net/use/usehome

## Installing OpenSwitch virtual appliance on virtual box

   1. You can use an OpenSwitch virtual appliance to demo the control-plane features of OpenSwitch.
      While it is possible to get networking done through an OVA, it is beyond the scope of this manual to get the
      required network driver mapping to work.
   2. After you've selected a stable OpenSwitch image. Please use https://archive.openswitch.net/artifacts/periodic/master/0.3.0+<YYYYMMDDHH>/appliance/openswitch-appliance-image-appliance-0.3.0+<YYYYMMDDHH>.ova. For example:  [build_823_appliance](https://archive.openswitch.net/artifacts/periodic/master/0.3.0+2016031100/appliance/openswitch-appliance-image-appliance-0.3.0+2016031100.ova)
   3. On the VirtualBox, click on File > "Import Appliance" and select the OVA file downloaded above
   4. Click "Continue" and then "Import". This completes the importing of OVA file into your VirtualBox.
   5. Click on the VM instance you've just imported. It should show up as "OpenSwitch-0.3.0 Appliance".
      Click "Start > 'Normal Start' ".
      This will open a GUI window where you will notice that the OpenSwitch instance is booting up and launching.
   6. Once it has launched it would show you a prompt "switch login:". This is the switch login prompt.
      Please enter 'root' and you should be able to see a bash prompt.
   7. Enter 'vtysh' and it should take you to the switch prompt. Here you can access all the privilege mode
      commands and would be able to issue all the 'show' commands.
   8. Enter "configure terminal" and you should be in the configuration mode where you can try out different
      configurations like configuring OSPF/BGP/NTP etc. User guides for different features can be found here
      http://openswitch.net/use/usehome
  
  Connecting to OpenSwitch Instance using REST:
  =============================================
  Before moving forward to this section, confirm that the OpenSwitch instance is UP and Running through the VirtualBox dashboard. Also confirm 'ifconfig' output from the bash prompt within the OpenSwitch instance that it has valid IP address. If this criteria is not met, then please refer to troubleshooting guide for more info.
  1. Login to the switch and note the IPAddress of the switch. By issuing 'ifconfig' in the bash prompt you should see an output like this:
  root@switch:# ifconfig
  eth0  Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 08:12:24:12:14:84
      inet addr:192.168.2.19 Bcast:192.168.2.255 Mask:255.255.255.0
          .....
          2. REST documentation is hosted by OpenSwitch instance. So its very useful and easy to find it by going to http://IPAddress:8091/api/index.html. In this example: http://192.168.2.19:8091/api/index.html gives you the complete REST documentation.
          3. Using this portal you can try out different REST GET/PUT/POST calls. It would work directly by posting/getting information from the OVSDB. For more details refer to usage guides.
