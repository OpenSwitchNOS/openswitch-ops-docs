## Debugging code



There are two main ways to debug code:

- **On-target debugging**: Run the debugger on the target hardware and have a local copy of the symbols and source code.

- **Off-target debugging**: Run the debugger on the developer machine and connect remotely to a debugging agent on the target hardware. The symbols and source code refer to locations on the developer's machine.



Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. Both are supported; it is up to the developers to use the one they are comfortable with.



### Prerequisites for debugging



In order to debug code you need access to the debug symbols and the original source code used to compile the code.



Typically debug symbols are included on the binaries using the "-g" flag on gcc (however the details vary depending on the configuration system of your choice). For example on cmake is controlled with the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE configuration variable but for autotools you need to add the flag manually.



Furthermore, Yocto usually strips and extracts the debug symbols when building the packages of the final file system image, and places the debug symbols and relevant source files in a separate debug package.



For most libraries/programs in OpenSwitch that are developed with cmake, if the recipe inherits the openswitch class, then all the setup is taken care of. cmake is invoked in debug mode, and the packages are split to create the debug information. If your application is not based on cmake or inherited from this class, you will have to take care of these details yourself.



### On-target debugging



#### Setting up on-target debug



In order to perform on-target debugging, you need to include the debug packages in your final image. To do this, modify your local configuration with the following command from the top of your build directory:



``` bash

echo 'EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES="dbg-pkgs"' >> build/conf/local.conf

```



After adding that content to the `local.conf` file, build a new image and deploy it to the target hardware. Be aware that the size of the image may increase noticeably due to the inclusion of the source code.



#### Using on-target debug



For every application and library compile with debug symbols, you will find a `.debug` file in the `/usr/lib/debug` directory, and the corresponding source file at `/usr/src/debug`. For example if you want to debug the `/usr/bin/vland` daemon, the symbol file will be located at `/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/vland.debug`, and the file paths will point to the right location at the `/usr/src/debug` directory. For debugging daemons built using autotools the debug symbol files will be in `/usr/lib/debug/usr/sbin/`.



For example to debug the running vland instance, you could connect to the process with the following commands on the target:



```bash

$ ps aux | grep vland # to find the PID of the running daemon, let's say was 266

$ gdb

(gdb) file /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/vland.debug

(gdb) attach 266

```



### Off-target debugging



Yocto provides integration with Eclipse as IDE for development and debugging of code. This makes debug more effective. Before you start, it is necessary to check the following steps:



1. Install Eclipse and all the components that the environment needs. For more information, see [Working using Eclipse as IDE](#working-using-eclipse-as-ide).

1. Set up the developer environment.  For more information, see [Managing the Development Environment](#./development-environment.md).

1. Run the TCF Agent on the device, so that you can connect to it by telnet and run the following command `systemctl start tcf-agent`. The TCF agent is  run over the port 1534. If it is necessary to check the agent, run `netstat -nl` and you will see the following:

``` bash

Active Internet connections (only servers)

Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State

tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5355            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1943            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1534            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

tcp        0      0 :::5355                 :::*                    LISTEN

tcp        0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN

udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5355            0.0.0.0:*

udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:1534            0.0.0.0:*

```



The TCF-Agent is in charge of the communication between the device and Eclipse. It broadcasts in auto discovery mode.



The following steps creates the project in Eclipse based on a Yocto template:



1. Open Eclipse.

1. Select File -> Import -> General - > Existing Projects into WorkSpace and click Next.



To import projects:

1.   Browse to the root directory and look for your code. The code is similar to the following: `directory/src/package_name`.

2.   Click Finish. In the Project Explorer you will see the daemon that you are working with.

Select the project:

1.  Select Go to Project-> Clean

1. Select Go to Project-> Build All



## Using Eclipse as an IDE



Since OpenSwitch is built using Yocto, it provides integration with Eclipse as an IDE for development and debugging of code. To work with it you need to install a recent version of Eclipse and certain plugins that guarantee a smooth experience with it.



### Installing Eclipse and dependencies



You can skip this step if you are using a Vagrant-based OpenSwitch machine for development, as it ships with Eclipse installed in the /opt/eclipse directory.



``` bash

$ wget http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/eclipse//technology/epp/downloads/release/luna/SR2/eclipse-cpp-luna-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz

$ sudo tar xzf eclipse-cpp-luna-SR2-linux-gtk-x86_64.tar.gz -C /opt/

### Configuring Eclipse



1. Ensure that you properly set up your proxy settings in Window -> Preferences -> General -> Network connection. Otherwise, if you are running over x2go, Eclipse does not inherit the proxy settings from your console environment. 

1. Create a profile to work with your OpenSwitch environment in Window -> Preferences -> Yocto Project ADT.

1. In Cross Compiler Options select 'Build system derivated toolchain' and you are prompted to enter the Toolchain Root Location, Sysroot Location, Target Architecture, and Target Options. The following shows the Toolchain and architecture path variables and the Target Options selection:

    - Toolchain Root Location: `</path/to/openSwitch/directory>/build`

    - Sysroot Location: `</path/to/openSwitch/directory>/build/tmp/sysroots/<machine name>`

    - Target Architecture: `auto-select`

    - Target Options:

      - 	External HW
